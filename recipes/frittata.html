    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        We love this potato zucchini frittata–I’ve always thought a frittata was Spanish, but come to find out, it’s Italian! Eggs, check! Vegetables, check! Herbs, check! Cheese, check! And a little bacon makes everything better. It’s great for breakfast with fresh fruit and toast, or for lunch or brunch, with a salad and a baguette.

        <li>7 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li>

        Directions
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a 10-inch ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add onions to the hot oil and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, and then stir in the zucchini slices. Cook, stirring occasionally, about 3 more minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in thawed potatoes and cook until heated through, about 3 more minutes. Stir in a pinch or two of salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Add drained Rotel, stir, and remove from heat. Use the back of a spoon to smooth the vegetables into an even layer.
        </li>
        <li>Whisk eggs, remaining salt and black pepper, smoked paprika, Mexican oregano, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl. Stir in milk, and sour cream until combined. Pour egg mixture into the vegetables in the skillet, and shake gently to eliminate air pockets. Sprinkle evenly with Cheddar cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let stand about 5 minutes.
</li>
        Garnish with sliced green onions, fresh parsley, and tomato slices, and serve warm.</li>
